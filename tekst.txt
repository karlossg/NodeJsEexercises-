Functional-Light JavaScript

Chapter 10: Functional Async

At this point of the book, you now have all the raw concepts in place for the foundations of FP that I call "Functional-Light Programming". In this chapter, we're going to apply these concepts to a different context, but we won't really present particularly new ideas.

So far, almost everything we've done is synchronous, meaning that we call functions with immediate inputs and immediately get back output values. A lot of work can be done this way, but it's not nearly sufficient for the entirety of a modern JS application. To be truly ready for FP in the real world of JS, we need to understand async FP.

Our goal in this chapter is to expand our thinking about managing values with FP, to spread out such operations over time. We'll see that Observables (and Promises!) are one great way to do that.
